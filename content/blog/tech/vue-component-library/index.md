I published a blog post several years ago on freeCodeCamp about
[how to create a Vue component library](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-and-publish-a-vue-component-library/).

It is outdated now, but there is a more updated one
[here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-and-publish-a-vue-component-library-update/).
